This project is a Java-based simulator that incorporates Java GUI to create and manipulate basic logic gates. The program allows users to draw various logic gates and connect them to form complex circuits. The simulator can evaluate these circuits using the basic gates and display the corresponding output, represented by flashing LED lights. Additionally, users have the ability to remove specific gates using the delete button, or clear the entire frame using the clear button. Overall, this program offers a comprehensive and interactive platform for designing, testing, and visualizing logic circuits.
